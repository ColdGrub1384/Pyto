                                 Apache License
                           Version 2.0, January 2004
                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/
   
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
   
   1. Definitions.
   
      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
   
      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
   
      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
   
      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.
   
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.
   
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.
   
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
   
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
   
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
   
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
   
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
   
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
   
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
   
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
   
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
   
   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
   
   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
   
      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
      same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
      identification within third-party archives.

   Copyright (C) 2013-2014, NumFOCUS Foundation.
   All rights reserved.
   
   This library is derived, with permission, from the International
   Astronomical Union's "Standards of Fundamental Astronomy" library,
   available from http://www.iausofa.org.
   
   The ERFA version is intended to retain identical
   functionality to the SOFA library, but made distinct through
   different function and file names, as set out in the SOFA license
   conditions. The SOFA original has a role as a reference standard
   for the IAU and IERS, and consequently redistribution is permitted only
   in its unaltered state. The ERFA version is not subject to this
   restriction and therefore can be included in distributions which do not
   support the concept of "read only" software.
   
   Although the intent is to replicate the SOFA API (other than replacement of
   prefix names) and results (with the exception of bugs; any that are
   discovered will be fixed), SOFA is not responsible for any errors found
   in this version of the library.
   
   If you wish to acknowledge the SOFA heritage, please acknowledge that
   you are using a library derived from SOFA, rather than SOFA itself.

   Our Copyright Policy
   --------------------
   Nucleic uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
   over their contributions to Nucleic. But, it is important to note that these
   contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Nucleic
   source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
   institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Nucleic
   Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
   changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
   their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the
   change to one of the Nucleic repositories.
   
   With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
   to indicate the copyright and license terms:

   lxml is copyright Infrae and distributed under the BSD license (see
   doc/licenses/BSD.txt), with the following exceptions:
   
   Some code, such a selftest.py, selftest2.py and
   src/lxml/_elementpath.py are derived from ElementTree and
   cElementTree. See doc/licenses/elementtree.txt for the license text.
   
   lxml.cssselect and lxml.html are copyright Ian Bicking and distributed
   under the BSD license (see doc/licenses/BSD.txt).
   
   test.py, the test-runner script, is GPL and copyright Shuttleworth
   Foundation. See doc/licenses/GPL.txt. It is believed the unchanged
   inclusion of test.py to run the unit test suite falls under the
   "aggregation" clause of the GPL and thus does not affect the license
   of the rest of the package.
   
   The isoschematron implementation uses several XSL and RelaxNG resources:
    * The (XML syntax) RelaxNG schema for schematron, copyright International
      Organization for Standardization (see 
      src/lxml/isoschematron/resources/rng/iso-schematron.rng for the license
      text)
    * The skeleton iso-schematron-xlt1 pure-xslt schematron implementation
      xsl stylesheets, copyright Rick Jelliffe and Academia Sinica Computing
      Center, Taiwan (see the xsl files here for the license text: 
      src/lxml/isoschematron/resources/xsl/iso-schematron-xslt1/)
    * The xsd/rng schema schematron extraction xsl transformations are unlicensed
      and copyright the respective authors as noted (see 
      src/lxml/isoschematron/resources/xsl/RNG2Schtrn.xsl and

   SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   
   PREAMBLE
   The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
   development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
   efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
   open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
   with others.
   
   The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
   redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
   fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
   redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
   names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
   however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
   requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
   to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
   
   DEFINITIONS
   "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
   Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
   include source files, build scripts and documentation.
   
   "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
   copyright statement(s).
   
   "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
   distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
   
   "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
   or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
   Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
   new environment.
   
   "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
   writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

   # CC0 1.0 Universal
   
   ## Statement of Purpose
   
   The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
   exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
   subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an “owner”) of an original work of
   authorship and/or a database (each, a “Work”).
   
   Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
   purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
   (“Commons”) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
   infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
   redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
   including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
   to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
   production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
   greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
   others.
   
   For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
   additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
   Work (the “Affirmer”), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
   and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
   publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
   Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
   effect of CC0 on those rights.
   
   1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
      protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and
      Related Rights”). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
      to, the following:
      1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
         and translate a Work;
      2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
      3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person’s image or likeness
         depicted in a Work;
      4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
         subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
      5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
         a Work;
      6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
         European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
         protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
         including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
      7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
         based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
         thereof.
   
   2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
      applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
      unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer’s Copyright
      and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
      known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
      action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
      duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
      extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
      copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
      commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “Waiver”). Affirmer
      makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
      to the detriment of Affirmer’s heirs and successors, fully intending that
      such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
      termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
      enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer’s express
      Statement of Purpose.
   
   3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
      judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
      shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
      Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
      Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
      royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
      irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer’s Copyright and
      Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
      maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
      extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
      copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
      commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the “License”). The License
      shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
      Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
      invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
      ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
      such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
      of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
      assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
      in either case contrary to Affirmer’s express Statement of Purpose.
   
   4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
      1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
         surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
      2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
         of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or
         otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
         merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
         the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
         absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
         extent permissible under applicable law.
      3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
         that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
         limitation any person’s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
         Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
         consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
      4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
         party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
         CC0 or use of the Work.

   legally  without a  software license.   In  order to  make this  project
   usable  to a vast  majority of  developers, we  distribute it  under two
   mutually exclusive open-source licenses.
   
   This means  that *you* must choose  *one* of the  two licenses described
   below, then obey  all its terms and conditions when  using FreeType 2 in
   any of your projects or products.
   
     - The FreeType License, found in  the file `FTL.TXT', which is similar
       to the original BSD license *with* an advertising clause that forces
       you  to  explicitly cite  the  FreeType  project  in your  product's
       documentation.  All  details are in the license  file.  This license
       is  suited  to products  which  don't  use  the GNU  General  Public
       License.
   
       Note that  this license  is  compatible  to the  GNU General  Public
       License version 3, but not version 2.
   
     - The GNU General Public License version 2, found in  `GPLv2.TXT' (any
       later version can be used  also), for programs which already use the
       GPL.  Note  that the  FTL is  incompatible  with  GPLv2 due  to  its
       advertisement clause.
   
   The contributed BDF and PCF drivers come with a license similar  to that
   of the X Window System.  It is compatible to the above two licenses (see
   file src/bdf/README and src/pcf/README).
   
   The gzip module uses the zlib license (see src/gzip/zlib.h) which too is
   compatible to the above two licenses.
   
   The MD5 checksum support (only used for debugging in development builds)
   is in the public domain.

      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
   
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
   
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
   
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
   
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
   
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
   
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                           http://www.apache.org/licenses/
   
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
   
      1. Definitions.
   
         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
         and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
   
         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
         the copyright owner that is granting the License.
   
         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
         "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
   
         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
         exercising permissions granted by this License.
   
         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.
   
         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.
   
         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
   
         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
   
         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
   
         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   
      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   
      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.
   
      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:
   
         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
   
         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and
   
         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and
   
         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.
   
         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.
   
      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   
      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   
      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   
      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   
      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
   
      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
   
      APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
   
         To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
         boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
         replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
         the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
         comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
         file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
         same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
         identification within third-party archives.

   Intel Corporation
   
   Software Grant License Agreement ("Agreement")
   
   Except for the license granted herein to you, Intel Corporation ("Intel") reserves
   all right, title, and interest in and to the Software (defined below).
   
   Definition
   
   "Software" means the code and documentation as well as any original work of
   authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that
   is intentionally submitted by Intel to llvm.org (http://llvm.org) ("LLVM") for
   inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by LLVM
   (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of
   electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to LLVM or its
   representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic
   mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are
   managed by, or on behalf of, LLVM for the purpose of discussing and improving
   the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked otherwise.
   
   1. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
      Agreement, Intel hereby grants to you and to recipients of the Software
      distributed by LLVM a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
      royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative
      works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Software and such derivative works.
   
   2. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
      Agreement, Intel hereby grants you and to recipients of the Software
      distributed by LLVM a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
      royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license
      to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
      the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by Intel that are necessarily infringed by Intel's Software alone or by
      combination of the Software with the Work to which such Software was
      submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against Intel or any
      other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
      that Intel's Software, or the Work to which Intel has contributed constitutes
      direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted
      to that entity under this Agreement for the Software or Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   
   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, the software is
   provided on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
   either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
   conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
   
   ==============================================================================
   
   ARM Limited
   
   Software Grant License Agreement ("Agreement")
   
   Except for the license granted herein to you, ARM Limited ("ARM") reserves all
   right, title, and interest in and to the Software (defined below).
   
   Definition
   
   "Software" means the code and documentation as well as any original work of
   authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that
   is intentionally submitted by ARM to llvm.org (http://llvm.org) ("LLVM") for
   inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by LLVM
   (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of
   electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to LLVM or its
   representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic
   mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are
   managed by, or on behalf of, LLVM for the purpose of discussing and improving
   the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked otherwise.
   
   1. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
      Agreement, ARM hereby grants to you and to recipients of the Software
      distributed by LLVM a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
      royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative
      works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Software and such derivative works.
   
   2. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
      Agreement, ARM hereby grants you and to recipients of the Software
      distributed by LLVM a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
      royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license
      to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer
      the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by ARM that are necessarily infringed by ARM's Software alone or by
      combination of the Software with the Work to which such Software was
      submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against ARM or any
      other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging
      that ARM's Software, or the Work to which ARM has contributed constitutes
      direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted
      to that entity under this Agreement for the Software or Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   
   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, the software is
   provided on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
   either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
   conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   
      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   
      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.
   
      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:
   
         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
   
         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and
   
         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and
   
         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.
   
         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.
   
      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   
      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   
      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   
      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   
      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
   
      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
   
      1. Definitions.
   
         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
         and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
   
         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by

         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
         "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
   
         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
         exercising permissions granted by this License.
   
         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,

         source, and configuration files.
   
         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.
   
         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
   
         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
   
         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   
      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   
      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.
   
      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:
   
         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
   
         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and
   
         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and
   
         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.
   
         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.
   
      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   
      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   
      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   
      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   
      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
   
      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
   
      APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
   
         To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
         boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
         replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

   1. This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Python Software Foundation ("PSF"), and
      the Individual or Organization ("Licensee") accessing and otherwise using Python
      2.7.12 software in source or binary form and its associated documentation.
   
   2. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, PSF hereby
      grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide license to reproduce,
      analyze, test, perform and/or display publicly, prepare derivative works,
      distribute, and otherwise use Python 2.7.12 alone or in any derivative
      version, provided, however, that PSF's License Agreement and PSF's notice of
      copyright, i.e., "Copyright © 2001-2016 Python Software Foundation; All Rights
      Reserved" are retained in Python 2.7.12 alone or in any derivative version
      prepared by Licensee.
   
   3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on or

                          Version 2.1, February 1999
   
    Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
   
   [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
    as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
    the version number 2.1.]
   
                               Preamble
   
     The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
   freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
   Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
   free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
   
     This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
   specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
   Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
   can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
   this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
   strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
   
     When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
   not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
   you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
   for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
   it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
   it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
   these things.
   
     To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
   distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
   rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
   you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
   
     For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
   or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
   you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
   code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
   complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
   with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
   it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
   
     We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
   library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
   permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
   
     To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
   there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
   modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
   that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
   author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
   introduced by others.
   
     Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
   any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
   effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
   restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
   any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
   consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
   
     Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
   ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
   General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
   is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
   this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
   libraries into non-free programs.
   
     When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
   a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
   combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
   General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
   entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
   Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
   the library.
   
     We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
   does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
   Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
   of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
   are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
   libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
   special circumstances.
   
     For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
   encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
   a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
   allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
   library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
   case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
   software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
   
     In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
   programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
   free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
   non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
   operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
   system.
   
     Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
   users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
   linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
   that program using a modified version of the Library.
   
     The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
   modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
   "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
   former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
   be combined with the library in order to run.
   
                     GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
   
     0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
   program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
   other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
   this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
   Each licensee is addressed as "you".
   
     A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
   prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
   (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
   
     The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
   which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
   Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
   copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
   portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
   straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
   included without limitation in the term "modification".)
   
     "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
   making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
   all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
   interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
   and installation of the library.
   
     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
   covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
   running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
   such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
   on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
   writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
   and what the program that uses the Library does.
   
     1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
   complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
   you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
   appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
   all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
   warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
   Library.
   
     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
   and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
   fee.
   
     2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
   of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
   distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
   above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
   
       a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
   
       b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
   
       c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
       charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
   
       d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
       table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
       the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
       is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
       in the event an application does not supply such function or
       table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
       its purpose remains meaningful.
   
       (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
       a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
       application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
       application-supplied function or table used by this function must
       be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
       root function must still compute square roots.)
   
   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
   identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
   and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
   themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
   sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
   distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
   on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
   this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
   entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
   it.
   
   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
   your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
   exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
   collective works based on the Library.
   
   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
   with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
   a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
   the scope of this License.
   
     3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
   License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
   this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
   that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
   instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
   ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
   that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
   these notices.
   
     Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
   that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
   subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
   
     This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
   the Library into a program that is not a library.
   
     4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
   derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
   under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
   it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
   must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
   medium customarily used for software interchange.
   
     If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
   from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
   source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
   distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
   compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
   
     5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
   Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
   linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
   work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
   therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
   
     However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
   creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
   contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
   library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
   Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
   
     When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
   that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
   derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
   Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
   linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
   threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
   
     If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
   structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
   functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
   file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
   work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
   Library will still fall under Section 6.)
   
     Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
   distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
   Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
   whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
   
     6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
   link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
   work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
   under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
   modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
   engineering for debugging such modifications.
   
     You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
   this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
   during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
   copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
   directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
   of these things:
   
       a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
       machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
       changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
       Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
       with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
       uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
       user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
       executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
       that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
       Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
       to use the modified definitions.)
   
       b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
       copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
       rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
       will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
       the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
       interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
   
       c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
       least three years, to give the same user the materials
       specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
       than the cost of performing this distribution.
   
       d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
       from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
       specified materials from the same place.
   
       e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
       materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
   
     For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
   Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
   reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
   the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
   normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
   components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
   which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
   the executable.
   
     It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
   restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
   accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
   use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
   distribute.
   
     7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
   Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
   facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
   library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
   the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
   permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
   
       a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
       based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
       facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
       Sections above.
   
       b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
       that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
       where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
   
     8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
   the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
   attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
   distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
   rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
   or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
   terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
   
     9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
   signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
   distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
   prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
   modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
   all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
   the Library or works based on it.
   
     10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
   original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
   subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
   You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
   this License.
   
     11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
   distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
   may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
   license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
   all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
   the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
   refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
   
   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
   and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
   
   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
   patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
   such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
   integrity of the free software distribution system which is
   implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
   generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
   through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
   system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
   to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
   impose that choice.
   
   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
   be a consequence of the rest of this License.
   
     12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
   certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
   original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
   an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
   so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
   excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
   written in the body of this License.
   
     13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
   versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
   Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
   but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
   
   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
   "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
   the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
   license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
   the Free Software Foundation.
   
     14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
   write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
   copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
   Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
   decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
   of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
   and reuse of software generally.
   
                               NO WARRANTY
   
     15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
   WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
   EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
   OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
   KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
   IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
   LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
   THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
   
     16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
   WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
   AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
   FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
   LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
   RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
   FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
   SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
   DAMAGES.

                      GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                          Version 3, 29 June 2007
   
    Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
   
     This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
   the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
   License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
   
     0. Additional Definitions.
   
     As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
   General Public License.
   
     "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
   other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
   
     An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
   by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
   Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
   of using an interface provided by the Library.
   
     A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
   Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
   with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
   Version".
   
     The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
   Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
   for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
   based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
   
     The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
   object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
   and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
   Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
   
     1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
   
     You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
   without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
   
     2. Conveying Modified Versions.
   
     If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
   facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
   that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
   facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
   version:
   
      a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
      ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
      function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
      whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
   
      b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
      this License applicable to that copy.
   
     3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
   
     The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
   a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
   code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
   material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
   layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
   (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
   
      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
      Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
      covered by this License.
   
      b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
      document.
   
     4. Combined Works.
   
     You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
   taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
   portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
   engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
   the following:
   
      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
      the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
      covered by this License.
   
      b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
      document.
   
      c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
      execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
      these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
      copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
   
      d) Do one of the following:
   
          0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
          License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
          suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
          recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
          the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
          manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
          Corresponding Source.
   
          1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
          Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
          a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
          system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
          of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
          Version.
   
      e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
      be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
      GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
      necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
      Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
      Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
      you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
      the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
      Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
      Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
      for conveying Corresponding Source.)
   
     5. Combined Libraries.
   
     You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
   Library side by side in a single library together with other library
   facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
   License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
   choice, if you do both of the following:
   
      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
      on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
      conveyed under the terms of this License.
   
      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
      is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
      accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
   
     6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
   
     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
   of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
   versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
   differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
   
     Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
   Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
   of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
   applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that published version or of any later version
   published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
   received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
   
     If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
   whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
   apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
   permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
   Library.

             David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg
   
   
   
   Introduction
   ============
   
     The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
     some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
     various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
     FreeType Project.
   
     This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
     which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
     affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
     documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
   
     This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
     (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
     and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
     alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
   
       o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
         interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
   
       o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
         full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
   
       o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
         it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
         somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
         FreeType code. (`credits')
   
     We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
     software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
     We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
     assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
   
   
     Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
     credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
     encourage you to use the following text:
   
      """
       Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
       Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
      """
   
     Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
     actually use.
   
   
   Legal Terms
   ===========
   
   0. Definitions
   --------------
   
     Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
     and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
     distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
     Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
     beta or final release.
   
     `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
     `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
     code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
     This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
     engine'.
   
     This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
     FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
     documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
     original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
     If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
     this license, you must contact us to verify this.
   
     The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
     Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
     specified below.
   
   1. No Warranty
   --------------
   
     THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
     KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
     WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
     BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
     USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

   --------------------------------
   
   2.1. Grants
   
   Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
   non-exclusive license:
   
   (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
       Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
       modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
       Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
       as part of a Larger Work; and
   
   (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
       for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
       Contributions or its Contributor Version.
   
   2.2. Effective Date
   
   The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
   become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
   distributes such Contribution.
   
   2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
   
   The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
   this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
   distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
   Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
   Contributor:
   
   (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
       or
   
   (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
       modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
       Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
       Version); or
   
   (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
       its Contributions.
   
   This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
   or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
   the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
   
   2.4. Subsequent Licenses
   
   No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
   distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
   License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
   permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
   
   2.5. Representation
   
   Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
   Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
   to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
   
   2.6. Fair Use
   
   This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
   applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
   equivalents.
   
   2.7. Conditions
   
   Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
   in Section 2.1.
   
   3. Responsibilities
   -------------------
   
   3.1. Distribution of Source Form
   
   All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
   Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
   the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
   Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
   License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
   attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
   Form.
   
   3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
   
   If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
   
   (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
       Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
       the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
       Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
       than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
   
   (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
       License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
       license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
       the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
   
   3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
   
   You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
   provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
   the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
   Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
   Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
   License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
   under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
   the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
   Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
   License(s).
   
   3.4. Notices
   
   You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
   (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
   or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
   the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
   the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
   
   3.5. Application of Additional Terms
   
   You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
   indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
   Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
   behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
   such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
   You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
   liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
   indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
   disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
   jurisdiction.
   
   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
   ---------------------------------------------------
   
   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
   License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
   statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
   the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
   describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
   be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
   Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
   or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
   recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
   
   5. Termination
   --------------
   
   5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
   if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
   compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
   Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
   Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
   ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
   non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
   come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
   Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
   notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
   first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
   from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
   Your receipt of the notice.
   
   5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
   infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
   counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
   directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
   You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
   2.1 of this License shall terminate.
   
   5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
   end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
   have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
   prior to termination shall survive termination.

   *  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
   *  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
   *  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
   *  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
   *  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
   *  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
   *  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
   *  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
   *  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *

   *  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
   *                                                                      *

   *  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *
   *  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *
   *  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *

   *  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *

   ************************************************************************
   
   8. Litigation
   -------------
   
   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
   courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
   place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
   Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
   cross-claims or counter-claims.
   
   9. Miscellaneous
   ----------------
   
   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
   that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
   shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

   ---------------------------
   
   10.1. New Versions
   
   Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section

   steward.
   
   10.3. Modified Versions
   
   If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
   create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
   modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
   any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
   such modified license differs from this License).
   
   10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
   Licenses

   -----------------------------------------------------------
   SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   
   PREAMBLE
   The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
   development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
   efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
   open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
   with others.
   
   The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
   redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
   fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
   redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
   names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
   however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
   requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
   to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
   
   DEFINITIONS
   "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
   Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
   include source files, build scripts and documentation.
   
   "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
   copyright statement(s).
   
   "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
   distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
   
   "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
   or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
   Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
   new environment.
   
   "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
   writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
   
   PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
   Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
   a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
   redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
   Software, subject to the following conditions:
   
   1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
   in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
   
   2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
   redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
   contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
   included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
   in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
   binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
   
   3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
   Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
   Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
   presented to the users.
   
   4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
   Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
   Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
   Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
   permission.
   
   5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
   must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
   distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
   remain under this license does not apply to any document created
   using the Font Software.
   
   TERMINATION
   This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
   not met.
   
   DISCLAIMER
   THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,

                          Version 2.1, February 1999
   
    Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
   
   [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
    as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
    the version number 2.1.]
   
                               Preamble
   
     The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
   freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
   Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
   free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
   
     This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
   specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
   Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
   can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
   this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
   strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
   
     When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
   not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
   you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
   for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
   it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
   it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
   these things.
   
     To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
   distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
   rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
   you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
   
     For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
   or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
   you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
   code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
   complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
   with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
   it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
   
     We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
   library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
   permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
   
     To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
   there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
   modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
   that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
   author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
   introduced by others.
   
     Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
   any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
   effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
   restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
   any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
   consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
   
     Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
   ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
   General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
   is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
   this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
   libraries into non-free programs.
   
     When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
   a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
   combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
   General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
   entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
   Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
   the library.
   
     We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
   does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
   Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
   of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
   are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
   libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
   special circumstances.
   
     For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
   encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
   a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
   allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
   library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
   case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
   software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
   
     In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
   programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
   free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
   non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
   operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
   system.
   
     Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
   users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
   linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
   that program using a modified version of the Library.
   
     The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
   modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
   "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
   former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
   be combined with the library in order to run.
   
                     GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
   
     0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
   program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
   other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
   this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
   Each licensee is addressed as "you".
   
     A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
   prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
   (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
   
     The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
   which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
   Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
   copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
   portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
   straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
   included without limitation in the term "modification".)
   
     "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
   making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
   all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
   interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
   and installation of the library.
   
     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
   covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
   running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
   such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
   on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
   writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
   and what the program that uses the Library does.
   
     1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
   complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
   you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
   appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
   all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
   warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
   Library.
   
     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
   and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
   fee.
   
     2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
   of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
   distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
   above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
   
       a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
   
       b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
   
       c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
       charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
   
       d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
       table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
       the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
       is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
       in the event an application does not supply such function or
       table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
       its purpose remains meaningful.
   
       (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
       a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
       application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
       application-supplied function or table used by this function must
       be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
       root function must still compute square roots.)
   
   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
   identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
   and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
   themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
   sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
   distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
   on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
   this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
   entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
   it.
   
   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
   your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
   exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
   collective works based on the Library.
   
   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
   with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
   a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
   the scope of this License.
   
     3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
   License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
   this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
   that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
   instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
   ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
   that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
   these notices.
   
     Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
   that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
   subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
   
     This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
   the Library into a program that is not a library.
   
     4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
   derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
   under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
   it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
   must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
   medium customarily used for software interchange.
   
     If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
   from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
   source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
   distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
   compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
   
     5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
   Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
   linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
   work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
   therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
   
     However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
   creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
   contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
   library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
   Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
   
     When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
   that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
   derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
   Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
   linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
   threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
   
     If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
   structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
   functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
   file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
   work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
   Library will still fall under Section 6.)
   
     Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
   distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
   Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
   whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
   
     6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
   link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
   work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
   under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
   modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
   engineering for debugging such modifications.
   
     You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
   this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
   during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
   copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
   directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
   of these things:
   
       a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
       machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
       changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
       Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
       with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
       uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
       user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
       executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
       that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
       Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
       to use the modified definitions.)
   
       b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
       copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
       rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
       will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
       the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
       interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
   
       c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
       least three years, to give the same user the materials
       specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
       than the cost of performing this distribution.
   
       d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
       from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
       specified materials from the same place.
   
       e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
       materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
   
     For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
   Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
   reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
   the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
   normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
   components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
   which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
   the executable.
   
     It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
   restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
   accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
   use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
   distribute.
   
     7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
   Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
   facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
   library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
   the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
   permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
   
       a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
       based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
       facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
       Sections above.
   
       b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
       that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
       where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
   
     8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
   the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
   attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
   distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
   rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
   or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
   terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
   
     9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
   signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
   distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
   prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
   modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
   all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
   the Library or works based on it.
   
     10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
   original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
   subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
   You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
   this License.
   
     11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
   distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
   may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
   license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
   all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
   the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
   refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
   
   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
   and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
   
   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
   patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
   such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
   integrity of the free software distribution system which is
   implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
   generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
   through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
   system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
   to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
   impose that choice.
   
   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
   be a consequence of the rest of this License.
   
     12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
   certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
   original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
   an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
   so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
   excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
   written in the body of this License.
   
     13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
   versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
   Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
   but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
   
   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
   "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
   the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
   license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
   the Free Software Foundation.
   
     14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
   write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
   copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
   Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
   decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
   of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
   and reuse of software generally.
   
                               NO WARRANTY
   
     15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
   WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
   EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
   OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
   KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
   IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
   LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
   THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
   
     16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
   WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY

                          Version 3, 29 June 2007
   
    Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
   
     This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
   the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
   License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
   
     0. Additional Definitions.
   
     As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
   General Public License.
   
     "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
   other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
   
     An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
   by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
   Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
   of using an interface provided by the Library.
   
     A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
   Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
   with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
   Version".
   
     The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
   Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
   for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
   based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
   
     The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
   object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
   and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
   Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
   
     1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
   
     You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
   without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
   
     2. Conveying Modified Versions.
   
     If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
   facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
   that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
   facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
   version:
   
      a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
      ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
      function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
      whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
   
      b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
      this License applicable to that copy.
   
     3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
   
     The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
   a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
   code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
   material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
   layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
   (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
   
      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
      Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
      covered by this License.
   
      b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
      document.
   
     4. Combined Works.
   
     You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
   taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
   portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
   engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
   the following:
   
      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
      the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
      covered by this License.
   
      b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
      document.
   
      c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
      execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
      these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
      copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
   
      d) Do one of the following:
   
          0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
          License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
          suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
          recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
          the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
          manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
          Corresponding Source.
   
          1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
          Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
          a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
          system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
          of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
          Version.
   
      e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
      be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
      GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
      necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
      Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
      Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
      you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
      the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
      Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
      Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
      for conveying Corresponding Source.)
   
     5. Combined Libraries.
   
     You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
   Library side by side in a single library together with other library
   facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
   License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
   choice, if you do both of the following:
   
      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
      on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
      conveyed under the terms of this License.
   
      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
      is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
      accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
   
     6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
   
     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
   of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
   versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
   differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
   
     Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
   Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
   of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
   applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that published version or of any later version
   published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
   received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
   
     If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
   whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
   apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
   permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
   Library.

             David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg
   
   
   
   Introduction
   ============
   
     The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
     some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
     various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
     FreeType Project.
   
     This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
     which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
     affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
     documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
   
     This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
     (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
     and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
     alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
   
       o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
         interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
   
       o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
         full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
   
       o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
         it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
         somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
         FreeType code. (`credits')
   
     We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
     software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
     We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
     assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
   
   
     Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
     credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
     encourage you to use the following text:
   
      """
       Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
       Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
      """
   
     Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
     actually use.
   
   
   Legal Terms
   ===========
   
   0. Definitions
   --------------
   
     Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
     and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
     distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
     Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
     beta or final release.
   
     `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
     `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
     code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
     This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
     engine'.
   
     This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
     FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
     documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
     original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
     If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
     this license, you must contact us to verify this.
   
     The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
     Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
     specified below.
   
   1. No Warranty
   --------------
   
     THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
     KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
     WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
     BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
     USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.

   -----------------
   
     This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and

     display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
     sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
     forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
     authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
     herein, subject to the following conditions:
   
       o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
         (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
         the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
         documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
         original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
         files.

   --------------------------------
   
   2.1. Grants
   
   Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
   non-exclusive license:
   
   (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
       Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
       modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
       Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
       as part of a Larger Work; and
   
   (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
       for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
       Contributions or its Contributor Version.
   
   2.2. Effective Date
   
   The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
   become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
   distributes such Contribution.
   
   2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
   
   The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
   this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
   distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
   Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
   Contributor:
   
   (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
       or
   
   (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
       modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
       Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
       Version); or
   
   (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
       its Contributions.
   
   This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
   or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
   the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
   
   2.4. Subsequent Licenses
   
   No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
   distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
   License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
   permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
   
   2.5. Representation
   
   Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
   Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
   to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
   
   2.6. Fair Use
   
   This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
   applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
   equivalents.
   
   2.7. Conditions
   
   Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
   in Section 2.1.
   
   3. Responsibilities
   -------------------
   
   3.1. Distribution of Source Form
   
   All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
   Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
   the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
   Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
   License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
   attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
   Form.
   
   3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
   
   If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
   
   (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
       Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
       the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
       Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
       than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
   
   (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
       License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
       license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
       the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
   
   3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
   
   You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
   provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
   the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
   Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
   Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
   License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
   under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
   the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
   Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
   License(s).
   
   3.4. Notices
   
   You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
   (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
   or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
   the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
   the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
   
   3.5. Application of Additional Terms
   
   You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
   indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
   Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
   behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
   such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
   You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
   liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
   indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
   disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
   jurisdiction.
   
   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
   ---------------------------------------------------
   
   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
   License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
   statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
   the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
   describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
   be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
   Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
   or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
   recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
   
   5. Termination
   --------------
   
   5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
   if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
   compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
   Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
   Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
   ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
   non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
   come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
   Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
   notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
   first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
   from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
   Your receipt of the notice.
   
   5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
   infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
   counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
   directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
   You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
   2.1 of this License shall terminate.
   
   5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
   end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
   have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
   prior to termination shall survive termination.

   *  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
   *  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
   *  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
   *  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
   *  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
   *  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
   *  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
   *  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
   *  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
   *  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
   *  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
   *                                                                      *

   *                                                                      *
   *  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *
   *  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *
   *  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *

   *  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *

   *  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *
   *  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
   *  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *

   *                                                                      *
   ************************************************************************
   
   8. Litigation
   -------------
   
   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
   courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
   place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
   Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
   cross-claims or counter-claims.
   
   9. Miscellaneous
   ----------------
   
   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
   that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
   shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

   steward.
   
   10.3. Modified Versions
   
   If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
   create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
   modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
   any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
   such modified license differs from this License).
   
   10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
   Licenses

                          Version 2.1, February 1999
   
    Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
   
   [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
    as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
    the version number 2.1.]
   
                               Preamble
   
     The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
   freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
   Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
   free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
   
     This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
   specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
   Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
   can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
   this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
   strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
   
     When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
   not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
   you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
   for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
   it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
   it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
   these things.
   
     To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
   distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
   rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
   you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
   
     For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
   or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
   you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
   code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
   complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
   with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
   it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
   
     We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
   library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
   permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
   
     To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
   there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
   modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
   that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
   author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
   introduced by others.
   
     Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
   any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
   effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
   restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
   any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
   consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
   
     Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
   ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
   General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
   is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
   this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
   libraries into non-free programs.
   
     When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
   a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
   combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
   General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
   entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
   Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
   the library.
   
     We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
   does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
   Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
   of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
   are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
   libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
   special circumstances.
   
     For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
   encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
   a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
   allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
   library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
   case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
   software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
   
     In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
   programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
   free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
   non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
   operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
   system.
   
     Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
   users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
   linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
   that program using a modified version of the Library.
   
     The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
   modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
   "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
   former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
   be combined with the library in order to run.
   
                     GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
   
     0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
   program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
   other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
   this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
   Each licensee is addressed as "you".
   
     A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
   prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
   (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
   
     The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
   which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
   Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
   copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
   portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
   straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
   included without limitation in the term "modification".)
   
     "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
   making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
   all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
   interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
   and installation of the library.
   
     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
   covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
   running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
   such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
   on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
   writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
   and what the program that uses the Library does.
   
     1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
   complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
   you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
   appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
   all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
   warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
   Library.
   
     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
   and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
   fee.
   
     2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
   of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
   distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
   above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
   
       a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
   
       b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
   
       c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
       charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
   
       d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
       table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
       the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
       is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
       in the event an application does not supply such function or
       table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
       its purpose remains meaningful.
   
       (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
       a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
       application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
       application-supplied function or table used by this function must
       be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
       root function must still compute square roots.)
   
   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
   identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
   and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
   themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
   sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
   distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
   on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
   this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
   entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
   it.
   
   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
   your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
   exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
   collective works based on the Library.
   
   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
   with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
   a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
   the scope of this License.
   
     3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
   License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
   this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
   that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
   instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
   ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
   that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
   these notices.
   
     Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
   that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
   subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
   
     This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
   the Library into a program that is not a library.
   
     4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
   derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
   under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
   it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
   must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
   medium customarily used for software interchange.
   
     If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
   from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
   source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
   distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
   compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
   
     5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
   Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
   linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
   work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
   therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
   
     However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
   creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
   contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
   library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
   Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
   
     When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
   that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
   derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
   Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
   linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
   threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
   
     If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
   structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
   functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
   file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
   work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
   Library will still fall under Section 6.)
   
     Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
   distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
   Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
   whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
   
     6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
   link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
   work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
   under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
   modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
   engineering for debugging such modifications.
   
     You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
   this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
   during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
   copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
   directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
   of these things:
   
       a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
       machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
       changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
       Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
       with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
       uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
       user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
       executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
       that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
       Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
       to use the modified definitions.)
   
       b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
       copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
       rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
       will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
       the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
       interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
   
       c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
       least three years, to give the same user the materials
       specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
       than the cost of performing this distribution.
   
       d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
       from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
       specified materials from the same place.
   
       e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
       materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
   
     For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
   Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
   reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
   the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
   normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
   components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
   which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
   the executable.
   
     It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
   restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
   accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
   use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
   distribute.
   
     7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
   Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
   facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
   library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
   the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
   permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
   
       a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
       based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
       facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
       Sections above.
   
       b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
       that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
       where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
   
     8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
   the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
   attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
   distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
   rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
   or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
   terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
   
     9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
   signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
   distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
   prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
   modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
   all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
   the Library or works based on it.
   
     10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
   original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
   subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
   You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
   this License.
   
     11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
   distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
   may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
   license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
   all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
   the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
   refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
   
   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
   and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
   
   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
   patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
   such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
   integrity of the free software distribution system which is
   implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
   generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
   through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
   system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
   to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
   impose that choice.
   
   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
   be a consequence of the rest of this License.
   
     12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
   certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
   original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
   an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
   so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
   excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
   written in the body of this License.
   
     13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
   versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
   Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
   but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
   
   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
   "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
   the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
   license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
   the Free Software Foundation.
   
     14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
   write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
   copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
   Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
   decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
   of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
   and reuse of software generally.
   
                               NO WARRANTY
   
     15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
   WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
   EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
   OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
   KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
   IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
   LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
   THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
   
     16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
   WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
   AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
   FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
   LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
   RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
   FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
   SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
   DAMAGES.
   
                        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                      GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                          Version 3, 29 June 2007
   
    Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
   
     This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
   the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
   License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
   
     0. Additional Definitions.
   
     As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
   General Public License.
   
     "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
   other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
   
     An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
   by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
   Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
   of using an interface provided by the Library.
   
     A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
   Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
   with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
   Version".
   
     The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
   Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
   for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
   based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
   
     The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
   object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
   and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
   Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
   
     1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
   
     You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
   without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
   
     2. Conveying Modified Versions.
   
     If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
   facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
   that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
   facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
   version:
   
      a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
      ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
      function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
      whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
   
      b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
      this License applicable to that copy.
   
     3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
   
     The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
   a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
   code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
   material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
   layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
   (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
   
      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
      Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
      covered by this License.
   
      b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
      document.
   
     4. Combined Works.
   
     You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
   taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
   portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
   engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
   the following:
   
      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
      the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
      covered by this License.
   
      b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
      document.
   
      c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
      execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
      these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
      copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
   
      d) Do one of the following:
   
          0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
          License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
          suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
          recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
          the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
          manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
          Corresponding Source.
   
          1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
          Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
          a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
          system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
          of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
          Version.
   
      e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
      be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
      GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
      necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
      Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
      Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
      you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
      the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
      Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
      Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
      for conveying Corresponding Source.)
   
     5. Combined Libraries.
   
     You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
   Library side by side in a single library together with other library
   facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
   License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
   choice, if you do both of the following:
   
      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
      on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
      conveyed under the terms of this License.
   
      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
      is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
      accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
   
     6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
   
     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
   of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
   versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
   differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
   
     Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
   Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
   of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
   applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that published version or of any later version
   published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
   received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
   
     If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
   whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
   apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
   permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
   Library.

                               2006-Jan-27
   
                       Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by
             David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg
   
   
   
   Introduction
   ============
   
     The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
     some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
     various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
     FreeType Project.
   
     This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
     which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
     affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
     documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
   
     This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
     (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
     and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
     alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
   
       o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
         interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
   
       o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
         full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
   
       o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
         it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
         somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
         FreeType code. (`credits')
   
     We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
     software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
     We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
     assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
   
   
     Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
     credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
     encourage you to use the following text:
   
      """
       Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
       Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
      """
   
     Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
     actually use.
   
   
   Legal Terms
   ===========
   
   0. Definitions
   --------------
   
     Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
     and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
     distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
     Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
     beta or final release.
   
     `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
     `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
     code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
     This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
     engine'.
   
     This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
     FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
     documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
     original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
     If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
     this license, you must contact us to verify this.
   
     The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
     Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
     specified below.
   
   1. No Warranty
   --------------
   
     THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
     KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
     WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
     BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
     USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
   
   2. Redistribution
   -----------------
   
     This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
     irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
     display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
     sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
     forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
     authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
     herein, subject to the following conditions:
   
       o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
         (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
         the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
         documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
         original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
         files.
   
       o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
         states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
         FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
         encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
         documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
   
     These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
     the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
     our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
     to us.
   
   3. Advertising
   --------------
   
     Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
     the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
     purposes without specific prior written permission.
   
     We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
     following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
     or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
     `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
   
     As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
     accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
     material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
     authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
     Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
     Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
     of this license.
   
   4. Contacts
   -----------
   
     There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:
   
       o freetype@nongnu.org
   
         Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
         future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.
         If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you

   --------------------------------
   
   2.1. Grants
   
   Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
   non-exclusive license:
   
   (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
       Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
       modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
       Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
       as part of a Larger Work; and
   
   (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
       for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
       Contributions or its Contributor Version.
   
   2.2. Effective Date
   
   The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
   become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
   distributes such Contribution.
   
   2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
   
   The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
   this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
   distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
   Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
   Contributor:
   
   (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
       or
   
   (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
       modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
       Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
       Version); or
   
   (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
       its Contributions.
   
   This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
   or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
   the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
   
   2.4. Subsequent Licenses
   
   No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
   distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
   License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
   permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
   
   2.5. Representation
   
   Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
   Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
   to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
   
   2.6. Fair Use
   
   This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
   applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
   equivalents.
   
   2.7. Conditions
   
   Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
   in Section 2.1.
   
   3. Responsibilities
   -------------------
   
   3.1. Distribution of Source Form
   
   All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
   Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
   the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
   Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
   License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
   attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
   Form.
   
   3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
   
   If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
   
   (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
       Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
       the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
       Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
       than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
   
   (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
       License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
       license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
       the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
   
   3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
   
   You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
   provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
   the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
   Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
   Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
   License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
   under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
   the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
   Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
   License(s).
   
   3.4. Notices
   
   You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
   (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
   or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
   the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
   the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
   
   3.5. Application of Additional Terms
   
   You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
   indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
   Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
   behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
   such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
   You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
   liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
   indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
   disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
   jurisdiction.
   
   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
   ---------------------------------------------------
   
   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
   License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
   statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
   the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
   describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
   be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
   Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
   or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
   recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
   
   5. Termination
   --------------
   
   5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
   if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
   compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
   Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
   Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
   ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
   non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
   come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
   Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
   notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
   first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
   from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
   Your receipt of the notice.
   
   5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
   infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
   counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
   directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
   You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
   2.1 of this License shall terminate.
   
   5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
   end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
   have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
   prior to termination shall survive termination.

   A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
   ==========================
   
   Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
   Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
   as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
   principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
   
   In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
   National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
   in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
   software.
   
   In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
   BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
   year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
   Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
   https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
   created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
   Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.
   
   All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
   the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
   releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
   the various releases.
   
       Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                       from                                compatible? (1)
   
       0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
       1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
       1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
       2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
       1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
       2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
       2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
       2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
       2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
       2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
       2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes
   
   Footnotes:
   
   (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
       the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
       a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
       GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
       other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
   
   (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
       because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
       CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
       is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
   
   Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
   direction to make these releases possible.

         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,

         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
   
         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
         exercising permissions granted by this License.
   
         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.
   
         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.
   
         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
   
         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
   
         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
   
         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   
      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   
      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.
   
      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:
   
         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
   
         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and
   
         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and
   
         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.
   
         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.
   
      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   
      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   
      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   
      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   
      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
   
      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
   
      APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
   
         To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
         boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
         replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
         the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
         comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
         file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
         same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
         identification within third-party archives.
   
      Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]

         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
   
         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
   
         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
   
         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   
      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   
      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.
   
      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:
   
         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
   
         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and
   
         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and
   
         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.
   
         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.
   
      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   
      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   
      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   
      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   
      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
   
      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
   
      APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
   
         To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
         boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"

         comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
         file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
         same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
         identification within third-party archives.

         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
   
         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   
      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   
      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.
   
      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:
   
         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
   
         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and
   
         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and
   
         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.
   
         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.
   
      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   
      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   
      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   
      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   
      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
   -----------------------------------------------------------
   
   PREAMBLE
   The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
   development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
   efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
   open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
   with others.
   
   The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
   redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
   fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
   redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
   names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
   however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
   requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
   to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
   
   DEFINITIONS
   "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
   Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
   include source files, build scripts and documentation.
   
   "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
   copyright statement(s).
   
   "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
   distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).
   
   "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
   or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
   Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
   new environment.
   
   "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
   writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.
   
   PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
   Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
   a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
   redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font
   Software, subject to the following conditions:
   
   1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components,
   in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.
   
   2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
   redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
   contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
   included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
   in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
   binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
   
   3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
   Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
   Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
   presented to the users.
   
   4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
   Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
   Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the

   permission.
   
   5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
   must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
   distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
   remain under this license does not apply to any document created
   using the Font Software.
   
   TERMINATION

   not met.

                          Version 2.1, February 1999
   
    Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
   
   [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
    as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
    the version number 2.1.]
   
                               Preamble
   
     The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
   freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
   Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
   free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
   
     This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
   specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
   Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
   can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
   this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
   strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
   
     When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
   not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
   you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
   for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
   it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
   it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
   these things.
   
     To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
   distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
   rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
   you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
   
     For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
   or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
   you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
   code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
   complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
   with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
   it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
   
     We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
   library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
   permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
   
     To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
   there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
   modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
   that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
   author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
   introduced by others.
   
     Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
   any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
   effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
   restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
   any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
   consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
   
     Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
   ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
   General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
   is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
   this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
   libraries into non-free programs.
   
     When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
   a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
   combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
   General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
   entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
   Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
   the library.
   
     We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
   does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
   Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
   of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
   are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
   libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
   special circumstances.
   
     For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
   encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
   a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
   allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
   library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
   case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
   software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
   
     In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
   programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
   free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
   non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
   operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
   system.
   
     Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
   users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
   linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
   that program using a modified version of the Library.
   
     The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
   modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
   "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
   former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
   be combined with the library in order to run.
   
                     GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
   
     0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
   program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
   other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
   this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
   Each licensee is addressed as "you".
   
     A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
   prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
   (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
   
     The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
   which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
   Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
   copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
   portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
   straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
   included without limitation in the term "modification".)
   
     "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
   making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
   all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
   interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
   and installation of the library.
   
     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
   covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
   running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
   such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
   on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
   writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
   and what the program that uses the Library does.
   
     1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
   complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
   you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
   appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
   all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
   warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
   Library.
   
     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
   and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
   fee.
   
     2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
   of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
   distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
   above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
   
       a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
   
       b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
   
       c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
       charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
   
       d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
       table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
       the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
       is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
       in the event an application does not supply such function or
       table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
       its purpose remains meaningful.
   
       (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
       a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
       application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
       application-supplied function or table used by this function must
       be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
       root function must still compute square roots.)
   
   These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
   identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
   and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
   themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
   sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
   distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
   on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
   this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
   entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
   it.
   
   Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
   your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
   exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
   collective works based on the Library.
   
   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
   with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
   a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
   the scope of this License.
   
     3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
   License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
   this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
   that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
   instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
   ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
   that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
   these notices.
   
     Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
   that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
   subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
   
     This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
   the Library into a program that is not a library.
   
     4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
   derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
   under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
   it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
   must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
   medium customarily used for software interchange.
   
     If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
   from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
   source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
   distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
   compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
   
     5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
   Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
   linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
   work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
   therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
   
     However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
   creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
   contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
   library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
   Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
   
     When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
   that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
   derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
   Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
   linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
   threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
   
     If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
   structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
   functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
   file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
   work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
   Library will still fall under Section 6.)
   
     Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
   distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
   Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
   whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
   
     6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
   link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
   work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
   under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
   modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
   engineering for debugging such modifications.
   
     You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
   this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
   during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
   copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
   directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
   of these things:
   
       a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
       machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
       changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
       Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
       with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
       uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
       user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
       executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
       that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
       Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
       to use the modified definitions.)
   
       b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
       copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
       rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
       will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
       the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
       interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
   
       c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
       least three years, to give the same user the materials
       specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
       than the cost of performing this distribution.
   
       d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
       from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
       specified materials from the same place.
   
       e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
       materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
   
     For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
   Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
   reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
   the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
   normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
   components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
   which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
   the executable.
   
     It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
   restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
   accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
   use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
   distribute.
   
     7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
   Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
   facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
   library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
   the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
   permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
   
       a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
       based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
       facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
       Sections above.
   
       b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
       that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
       where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
   
     8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
   the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
   attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
   distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
   rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
   or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
   terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
   
     9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
   signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
   distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
   prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
   modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
   all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
   the Library or works based on it.
   
     10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
   Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
   original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
   subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
   restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
   You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
   this License.
   
     11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
   infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
   conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
   otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
   excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
   distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
   License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
   may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
   license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
   all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
   the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
   refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
   
   If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
   particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
   and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
   
   It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
   patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
   such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
   integrity of the free software distribution system which is
   implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
   generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
   through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
   system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
   to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
   impose that choice.
   
   This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
   be a consequence of the rest of this License.
   
     12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
   certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
   original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
   an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
   so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
   excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
   written in the body of this License.
   
     13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
   versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
   Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
   but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
   
   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
   specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
   "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
   the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
   license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
   the Free Software Foundation.
   
     14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
   programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
   write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
   copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
   Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
   decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
   of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
   and reuse of software generally.
   
                               NO WARRANTY
   
     15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
   WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
   EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
   OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
   KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
   IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
   LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
   THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
   
     16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
   WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
   AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
   FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
   CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
   LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
   RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
   FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
   SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
   DAMAGES.

                      GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                          Version 3, 29 June 2007
   
    Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
    of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
   
     This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
   the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
   License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
   
     0. Additional Definitions.
   
     As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
   General Public License.
   
     "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
   other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
   
     An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
   by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
   Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
   of using an interface provided by the Library.
   
     A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
   Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
   with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
   Version".
   
     The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
   Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
   for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
   based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
   
     The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
   object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
   and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
   Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
   
     1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
   
     You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
   without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
   
     2. Conveying Modified Versions.
   
     If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
   facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
   that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
   facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
   version:
   
      a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
      ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
      function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
      whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
   
      b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
      this License applicable to that copy.
   
     3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
   
     The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
   a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
   code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
   material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
   layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
   (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
   
      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
      Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
      covered by this License.
   
      b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
      document.
   
     4. Combined Works.
   
     You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
   taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
   portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
   engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
   the following:
   
      a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
      the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
      covered by this License.
   
      b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
      document.
   
      c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
      execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
      these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
      copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
   
      d) Do one of the following:
   
          0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
          License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
          suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
          recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
          the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
          manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
          Corresponding Source.
   
          1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
          Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
          a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
          system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
          of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
          Version.
   
      e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
      be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
      GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
      necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
      Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
      Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
      you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
      the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
      Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
      Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
      for conveying Corresponding Source.)
   
     5. Combined Libraries.
   
     You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
   Library side by side in a single library together with other library
   facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
   License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
   choice, if you do both of the following:
   
      a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
      on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
      conveyed under the terms of this License.
   
      b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
      is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
      accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
   
     6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
   
     The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
   of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
   versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
   differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
   
     Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
   Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
   of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
   applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
   conditions either of that published version or of any later version
   published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
   received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
   General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
   
     If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
   whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
   apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
   permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
   Library.

                               2006-Jan-27
   
                       Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by
             David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg
   
   
   
   Introduction
   ============
   
     The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
     some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
     various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
     FreeType Project.
   
     This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
     which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
     affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
     documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
   
     This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
     (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
     and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
     alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
   
       o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
         interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
   
       o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
         full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
   
       o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
         it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
         somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
         FreeType code. (`credits')
   
     We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
     software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
     We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
     assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
   
   
     Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
     credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
     encourage you to use the following text:
   
      """
       Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
       Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
      """
   
     Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
     actually use.
   
   
   Legal Terms
   ===========
   
   0. Definitions
   --------------
   
     Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
     and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
     distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
     Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
     beta or final release.
   
     `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
     `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
     code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
     This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
     engine'.
   
     This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
     FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
     documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
     original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
     If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
     this license, you must contact us to verify this.
   
     The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
     Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
     specified below.
   
   1. No Warranty
   --------------
   
     THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
     KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
     WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
     BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
     USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
   
   2. Redistribution
   -----------------
   
     This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
     irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
     display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
     sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
     forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
     authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
     herein, subject to the following conditions:
   
       o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
         (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
         the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
         documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
         original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
         files.
   
       o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
         states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
         FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
         encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
         documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
   
     These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
     the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
     our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
     to us.
   
   3. Advertising
   --------------
   
     Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
     the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
     purposes without specific prior written permission.
   
     We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
     following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
     or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
     `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
   
     As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
     accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
     material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
     authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
     Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
     Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
     of this license.
   
   4. Contacts
   -----------
   
     There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:
   
       o freetype@nongnu.org

       made, import, or transfer of either its Contributions or its
       Contributor Version.

   2. License Grants and Conditions
   --------------------------------
   
   2.1. Grants
   
   Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
   non-exclusive license:
   
   (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
       Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
       modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
       Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
       as part of a Larger Work; and
   
   (b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
       for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
       Contributions or its Contributor Version.
   
   2.2. Effective Date
   
   The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
   become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
   distributes such Contribution.
   
   2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
   
   The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
   this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
   distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
   Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
   Contributor:
   
   (a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
       or
   
   (b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
       modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
       Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
       Version); or
   
   (c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
       its Contributions.
   
   This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
   or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
   the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
   
   2.4. Subsequent Licenses
   
   No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
   distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
   License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
   permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
   
   2.5. Representation
   
   Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
   Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
   to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
   
   2.6. Fair Use
   
   This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
   applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
   equivalents.
   
   2.7. Conditions
   
   Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
   in Section 2.1.
   
   3. Responsibilities
   -------------------
   
   3.1. Distribution of Source Form
   
   All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
   Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
   the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
   Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
   License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
   attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
   Form.
   
   3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
   
   If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
   
   (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
       Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
       the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
       Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
       than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
   
   (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
       License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
       license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
       the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
   
   3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
   
   You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
   provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
   the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
   Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
   Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
   License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
   under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
   the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
   Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
   License(s).
   
   3.4. Notices
   
   You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
   (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
   or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
   the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
   the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
   
   3.5. Application of Additional Terms
   
   You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
   indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
   Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
   behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
   such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
   You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
   liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
   indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
   disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
   jurisdiction.
   
   4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
   ---------------------------------------------------
   
   If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
   License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
   statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
   the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
   describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
   be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
   Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
   or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
   recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
   
   5. Termination
   --------------
   
   5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
   if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
   compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
   Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
   Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
   ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
   non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
   come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
   Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
   notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
   first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
   from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
   Your receipt of the notice.
   
   5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
   infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
   counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
   directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
   You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
   2.1 of this License shall terminate.
   
   5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
   end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
   have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
   prior to termination shall survive termination.

   *  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"       *
   *  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *
   *  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *
   *  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *
   *  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *
   *  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *
   *  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *
   *  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *
   *  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *
   *  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *
   *  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *
   *                                                                      *

   *                                                                      *
   *  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *
   *  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *
   *  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *

   *  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *

   *  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *
   *  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *
   *  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *

   *                                                                      *
   ************************************************************************
   
   8. Litigation
   -------------
   
   Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
   courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
   place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
   jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
   Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
   cross-claims or counter-claims.
   
   9. Miscellaneous
   ----------------
   
   This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
   matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
   unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
   necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
   that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
   shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.

   steward.
   
   10.3. Modified Versions
   
   If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
   create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
   modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
   any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
   such modified license differs from this License).

   Licenses

      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
   
      1. Definitions.
   
         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
         and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
   
         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
         the copyright owner that is granting the License.
   
         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
         "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
   
         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
         exercising permissions granted by this License.
   
         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.
   
         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.
   
         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
   
         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
   
         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
   
         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   
      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   
      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.
   
      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:
   
         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
   
         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and
   
         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and
   
         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.
   
         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.
   
      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   
      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   
      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   
      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   
      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                                    Apache License
                              Version 2.0, January 2004
                           http://www.apache.org/licenses/
   
      TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
   
      1. Definitions.
   
         "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
         and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
   
         "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
         the copyright owner that is granting the License.
   
         "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
         other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
         control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
         "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
         direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
         otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
         outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
   
         "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
         exercising permissions granted by this License.
   
         "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
         including but not limited to software source code, documentation
         source, and configuration files.
   
         "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
         transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
         not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
         and conversions to other media types.
   
         "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
         Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
         copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
         (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
   
         "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
         form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
         editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
         represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
         of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
         separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
         the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
   
         "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
         the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
         to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
         submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
         or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
         the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
         means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
         to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
         communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
         and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
         Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
         excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
         designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
   
         "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
         on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
         subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   
      2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
         publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
         Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   
      3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
         this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
         worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
         (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
         use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
         where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
         by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
         Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
         with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
         institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
         cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
         or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
         or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
         granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
         as of the date such litigation is filed.
   
      4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
         Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
         modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
         meet the following conditions:
   
         (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
             Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
   
         (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
             stating that You changed the files; and
   
         (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
             that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
             attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
             excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
             the Derivative Works; and
   
         (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
             distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
             include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
             within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
             pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
             of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
             as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
             documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
             within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
             wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
             of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
             do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
             notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
             or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
             that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
             as modifying the License.
   
         You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
         may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
         for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
         for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
         reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
         the conditions stated in this License.
   
      5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
         any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
         by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
         this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
         Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
         the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
         with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   
      6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
         names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
         except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
         origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   
      7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
         agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
         Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
         WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
         implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
         of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
         PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
         appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
         risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   
      8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
         whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
         unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
         negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
         liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
         incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
         result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
         Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
         work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
         other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
         has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   
      9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
         the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
         and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
         or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
         License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
         on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
         of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
         defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
         incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
         of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
   
      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
   
      APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
   
         To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
         boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
         replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
         the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
         comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
         file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
         same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
         identification within third-party archives.
