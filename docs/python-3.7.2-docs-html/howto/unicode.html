<h2>Introduction to Unicode<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-unicode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="history-of-character-codes">
<h3>History of Character Codes<a class="headerlink" href="#history-of-character-codes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In 1968, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange, better known by
its acronym ASCII, was standardized.  ASCII defined numeric codes for various
characters, with the numeric values running from 0 to 127.  For example, the
lowercase letter ‘a’ is assigned 97 as its code value.</p>
<p>ASCII was an American-developed standard, so it only defined unaccented
characters.  There was an ‘e’, but no ‘é’ or ‘Í’.  This meant that languages
which required accented characters couldn’t be faithfully represented in ASCII.
(Actually the missing accents matter for English, too, which contains words such
as ‘naïve’ and ‘café’, and some publications have house styles which require
spellings such as ‘coöperate’.)</p>
<p>For a while people just wrote programs that didn’t display accents.
In the mid-1980s an Apple II BASIC program written by a French speaker
might have lines like these:</p>
<div class="highlight-basic notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kr">PRINT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;MISE A JOUR TERMINEE&quot;</span>
<span class="kr">PRINT</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;PARAMETRES ENREGISTRES&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Those messages should contain accents (terminée, paramètre, enregistrés) and
they just look wrong to someone who can read French.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, almost all personal computers were 8-bit, meaning that bytes could
hold values ranging from 0 to 255.  ASCII codes only went up to 127, so some
machines assigned values between 128 and 255 to accented characters.  Different
machines had different codes, however, which led to problems exchanging files.
Eventually various commonly used sets of values for the 128–255 range emerged.
Some were true standards, defined by the International Organization for
Standardization, and some were <em>de facto</em> conventions that were invented by one
company or another and managed to catch on.</p>
<p>255 characters aren’t very many.  For example, you can’t fit both the accented
characters used in Western Europe and the Cyrillic alphabet used for Russian
into the 128–255 range because there are more than 128 such characters.</p>
<p>You could write files using different codes (all your Russian files in a coding
system called KOI8, all your French files in a different coding system called
Latin1), but what if you wanted to write a French document that quotes some
Russian text?  In the 1980s people began to want to solve this problem, and the
Unicode standardization effort began.</p>
<p>Unicode started out using 16-bit characters instead of 8-bit characters.  16
bits means you have 2^16 = 65,536 distinct values available, making it possible
to represent many different characters from many different alphabets; an initial
goal was to have Unicode contain the alphabets for every single human language.
It turns out that even 16 bits isn’t enough to meet that goal, and the modern
Unicode specification uses a wider range of codes, 0 through 1,114,111 (
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0x10FFFF</span></code> in base 16).</p>
<p>There’s a related ISO standard, ISO 10646.  Unicode and ISO 10646 were
originally separate efforts, but the specifications were merged with the 1.1
revision of Unicode.</p>
<p>(This discussion of Unicode’s history is highly simplified.  The
precise historical details aren’t necessary for understanding how to
use Unicode effectively, but if you’re curious, consult the Unicode
consortium site listed in the References or
the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode#History">Wikipedia entry for Unicode</a>
for more information.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="definitions">
<h3>Definitions<a class="headerlink" href="#definitions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A <strong>character</strong> is the smallest possible component of a text.  ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’,
etc., are all different characters.  So are ‘È’ and ‘Í’.  Characters are
abstractions, and vary depending on the language or context you’re talking
about.  For example, the symbol for ohms (Ω) is usually drawn much like the
capital letter omega (Ω) in the Greek alphabet (they may even be the same in
some fonts), but these are two different characters that have different
meanings.</p>
<p>The Unicode standard describes how characters are represented by <strong>code
points</strong>.  A code point is an integer value, usually denoted in base 16.  In the
standard, a code point is written using the notation <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+12CA</span></code> to mean the
character with value <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0x12ca</span></code> (4,810 decimal).  The Unicode standard contains
a lot of tables listing characters and their corresponding code points:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>0061    &#39;a&#39;; LATIN SMALL LETTER A
0062    &#39;b&#39;; LATIN SMALL LETTER B
0063    &#39;c&#39;; LATIN SMALL LETTER C
...
007B    &#39;{&#39;; LEFT CURLY BRACKET
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Strictly, these definitions imply that it’s meaningless to say ‘this is
character <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+12CA</span></code>’.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+12CA</span></code> is a code point, which represents some particular
character; in this case, it represents the character ‘ETHIOPIC SYLLABLE WI’.  In
informal contexts, this distinction between code points and characters will
sometimes be forgotten.</p>
<p>A character is represented on a screen or on paper by a set of graphical
elements that’s called a <strong>glyph</strong>.  The glyph for an uppercase A, for example,
is two diagonal strokes and a horizontal stroke, though the exact details will
depend on the font being used.  Most Python code doesn’t need to worry about
glyphs; figuring out the correct glyph to display is generally the job of a GUI
toolkit or a terminal’s font renderer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="encodings">
<h3>Encodings<a class="headerlink" href="#encodings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To summarize the previous section: a Unicode string is a sequence of code
points, which are numbers from 0 through <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0x10FFFF</span></code> (1,114,111 decimal).  This
sequence needs to be represented as a set of bytes (meaning, values
from 0 through 255) in memory.  The rules for translating a Unicode string
into a sequence of bytes are called an <strong>encoding</strong>.</p>
<p>The first encoding you might think of is an array of 32-bit integers.  In this
representation, the string “Python” would look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   P           y           t           h           o           n
0x50 00 00 00 79 00 00 00 74 00 00 00 68 00 00 00 6f 00 00 00 6e 00 00 00
   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This representation is straightforward but using it presents a number of
problems.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>It’s not portable; different processors order the bytes differently.</li>
<li>It’s very wasteful of space.  In most texts, the majority of the code points
are less than 127, or less than 255, so a lot of space is occupied by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0x00</span></code>
bytes.  The above string takes 24 bytes compared to the 6 bytes needed for an
ASCII representation.  Increased RAM usage doesn’t matter too much (desktop
computers have gigabytes of RAM, and strings aren’t usually that large), but
expanding our usage of disk and network bandwidth by a factor of 4 is
intolerable.</li>
<li>It’s not compatible with existing C functions such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">strlen()</span></code>, so a new
family of wide string functions would need to be used.</li>
<li>Many Internet standards are defined in terms of textual data, and can’t
handle content with embedded zero bytes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Generally people don’t use this encoding, instead choosing other
encodings that are more efficient and convenient.  UTF-8 is probably
the most commonly supported encoding; it will be discussed below.</p>
<p>Encodings don’t have to handle every possible Unicode character, and most
encodings don’t.  The rules for converting a Unicode string into the ASCII
encoding, for example, are simple; for each code point:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>If the code point is &lt; 128, each byte is the same as the value of the code
point.</li>
<li>If the code point is 128 or greater, the Unicode string can’t be represented
in this encoding.  (Python raises a <a class="reference internal" href="../library/exceptions.html#UnicodeEncodeError" title="UnicodeEncodeError"><code class="xref py py-exc docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">UnicodeEncodeError</span></code></a> exception in this
case.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Latin-1, also known as ISO-8859-1, is a similar encoding.  Unicode code points
0–255 are identical to the Latin-1 values, so converting to this encoding simply
requires converting code points to byte values; if a code point larger than 255
is encountered, the string can’t be encoded into Latin-1.</p>
<p>Encodings don’t have to be simple one-to-one mappings like Latin-1.  Consider
IBM’s EBCDIC, which was used on IBM mainframes.  Letter values weren’t in one
block: ‘a’ through ‘i’ had values from 129 to 137, but ‘j’ through ‘r’ were 145
through 153.  If you wanted to use EBCDIC as an encoding, you’d probably use
some sort of lookup table to perform the conversion, but this is largely an
internal detail.</p>
<p>UTF-8 is one of the most commonly used encodings.  UTF stands for “Unicode
Transformation Format”, and the ‘8’ means that 8-bit numbers are used in the
encoding.  (There are also a UTF-16 and UTF-32 encodings, but they are less
frequently used than UTF-8.)  UTF-8 uses the following rules:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>If the code point is &lt; 128, it’s represented by the corresponding byte value.</li>
<li>If the code point is &gt;= 128, it’s turned into a sequence of two, three, or
four bytes, where each byte of the sequence is between 128 and 255.</li>
</ol>
<p>UTF-8 has several convenient properties:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>It can handle any Unicode code point.</li>
<li>A Unicode string is turned into a sequence of bytes containing no embedded zero
bytes.  This avoids byte-ordering issues, and means UTF-8 strings can be
processed by C functions such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">strcpy()</span></code> and sent through protocols that
can’t handle zero bytes.</li>
<li>A string of ASCII text is also valid UTF-8 text.</li>
<li>UTF-8 is fairly compact; the majority of commonly used characters can be
represented with one or two bytes.</li>
<li>If bytes are corrupted or lost, it’s possible to determine the start of the
next UTF-8-encoded code point and resynchronize.  It’s also unlikely that
random 8-bit data will look like valid UTF-8.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Python’s Unicode Support<a class="headerlink" href="#python-s-unicode-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that you’ve learned the rudiments of Unicode, we can look at Python’s
Unicode features.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-string-type">
<h3>The String Type<a class="headerlink" href="#the-string-type" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Since Python 3.0, the language features a <a class="reference internal" href="../library/stdtypes.html#str" title="str"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span></code></a> type that contain Unicode
characters, meaning any string created using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&quot;unicode</span> <span class="pre">rocks!&quot;</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'unicode</span>
<span class="pre">rocks!'</span></code>, or the triple-quoted string syntax is stored as Unicode.</p>
<p>The default encoding for Python source code is UTF-8, so you can simply
include a Unicode character in a string literal:</p>
<div class="highlight-python3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">try</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;/tmp/input.txt&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;r&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="o">...</span>
<span class="k">except</span> <span class="ne">OSError</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="c1"># &#39;File not found&#39; error message.</span>
    <span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Fichier non trouvé&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can use a different encoding from UTF-8 by putting a specially-formatted
comment as the first or second line of the source code:</p>
<div class="highlight-python3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># -*- coding: &lt;encoding name&gt; -*-</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Side note: Python 3 also supports using Unicode characters in identifiers:</p>
<div class="highlight-python3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">répertoire</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/tmp/records.log&quot;</span>
<span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">répertoire</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;w&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;test</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you can’t enter a particular character in your editor or want to
keep the source code ASCII-only for some reason, you can also use
escape sequences in string literals. (Depending on your system,
you may see the actual capital-delta glyph instead of a u escape.)</p>
<div class="highlight-python3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="se">\N{GREEK CAPITAL LETTER DELTA}</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>  <span class="c1"># Using the character name</span>
<span class="go">&#39;\u0394&#39;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="se">\u0394</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>                          <span class="c1"># Using a 16-bit hex value</span>
<span class="go">&#39;\u0394&#39;</span>

<span class="go">&#39;\u0394&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In addition, one can create a string using the <a class="reference internal" href="../library/stdtypes.html#bytes.decode" title="bytes.decode"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">decode()</span></code></a> method of
<a class="reference internal" href="../library/stdtypes.html#bytes" title="bytes"><code class="xref py py-class docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bytes</span></code></a>.  This method takes an <em>encoding</em> argument, such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">UTF-8</span></code>,
and optionally an <em>errors</em> argument.</p>
<p>The <em>errors</em> argument specifies the response when the input string can’t be
converted according to the encoding’s rules.  Legal values for this argument are
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'strict'</span></code> (raise a <a class="reference internal" href="../library/exceptions.html#UnicodeDecodeError" title="UnicodeDecodeError"><code class="xref py py-exc docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">UnicodeDecodeError</span></code></a> exception), <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'replace'</span></code> (use
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+FFFD</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">REPLACEMENT</span> <span class="pre">CHARACTER</span></code>), <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'ignore'</span></code> (just leave the
character out of the Unicode result), or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'backslashreplace'</span></code> (inserts a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\xNN</span></code> escape sequence).
The following examples show the differences:</p>
<div class="highlight-python3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="sa">b</span><span class="s1">&#39;</span><span class="se">\x80</span><span class="s1">abc&#39;</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">decode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;utf-8&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;strict&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>Encodings are specified as strings containing the encoding’s name.  Python 3.2
comes with roughly 100 different encodings; see the Python Library Reference at
<a class="reference internal" href="../library/codecs.html#standard-encodings"><span class="std std-ref">Standard Encodings</span></a> for a list.  Some encodings have multiple names; for
example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'latin-1'</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'iso_8859_1'</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'8859</span></code>’ are all synonyms for
the same encoding.</p>
<p>One-character Unicode strings can also be created with the <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#chr" title="chr"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chr()</span></code></a>

that contains the corresponding code point.  The reverse operation is the
built-in <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#ord" title="ord"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ord()</span></code></a> function that takes a one-character Unicode string and

<p>Using escape sequences for code points greater than 127 is fine in small doses,
but becomes an annoyance if you’re using many accented characters, as you would
in a program with messages in French or some other accent-using language.  You
can also assemble strings using the <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#chr" title="chr"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chr()</span></code></a> built-in function, but this is
even more tedious.</p>
<p>Ideally, you’d want to be able to write literals in your language’s natural
encoding.  You could then edit Python source code with your favorite editor
which would display the accented characters naturally, and have the right
characters used at runtime.</p>
<p>Python supports writing source code in UTF-8 by default, but you can use almost
any encoding if you declare the encoding being used.  This is done by including
a special comment as either the first or second line of the source file:</p>
<div class="highlight-python3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ch">#!/usr/bin/env python</span>
<span class="c1"># -*- coding: latin-1 -*-</span>

<span class="n">u</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;abcdé&#39;</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The syntax is inspired by Emacs’s notation for specifying variables local to a
file.  Emacs supports many different variables, but Python only supports
‘coding’.  The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-*-</span></code> symbols indicate to Emacs that the comment is special;
they have no significance to Python but are a convention.  Python looks for
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">coding:</span> <span class="pre">name</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">coding=name</span></code> in the comment.</p>
<p>If you don’t include such a comment, the default encoding used will be UTF-8 as
already mentioned.  See also <span class="target" id="index-0"></span><a class="pep reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263"><strong>PEP 263</strong></a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Reading and Writing Unicode Data<a class="headerlink" href="#reading-and-writing-unicode-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once you’ve written some code that works with Unicode data, the next problem is
input/output.  How do you get Unicode strings into your program, and how do you
convert Unicode into a form suitable for storage or transmission?</p>
<p>It’s possible that you may not need to do anything depending on your input
sources and output destinations; you should check whether the libraries used in
your application support Unicode natively.  XML parsers often return Unicode
data, for example.  Many relational databases also support Unicode-valued
columns and can return Unicode values from an SQL query.</p>
<p>Unicode data is usually converted to a particular encoding before it gets
written to disk or sent over a socket.  It’s possible to do all the work
yourself: open a file, read an 8-bit bytes object from it, and convert the bytes
with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bytes.decode(encoding)</span></code>.  However, the manual approach is not recommended.</p>
<p>One problem is the multi-byte nature of encodings; one Unicode character can be
represented by several bytes.  If you want to read the file in arbitrary-sized
chunks (say, 1024 or 4096 bytes), you need to write error-handling code to catch the case
where only part of the bytes encoding a single Unicode character are read at the
end of a chunk.  One solution would be to read the entire file into memory and
then perform the decoding, but that prevents you from working with files that
are extremely large; if you need to read a 2 GiB file, you need 2 GiB of RAM.
(More, really, since for at least a moment you’d need to have both the encoded
string and its Unicode version in memory.)</p>
<p>The solution would be to use the low-level decoding interface to catch the case
of partial coding sequences.  The work of implementing this has already been
done for you: the built-in <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#open" title="open"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">open()</span></code></a> function can return a file-like object
that assumes the file’s contents are in a specified encoding and accepts Unicode
parameters for methods such as <a class="reference internal" href="../library/io.html#io.TextIOBase.read" title="io.TextIOBase.read"><code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">read()</span></code></a> and
<a class="reference internal" href="../library/io.html#io.TextIOBase.write" title="io.TextIOBase.write"><code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">write()</span></code></a>.  This works through <a class="reference internal" href="../library/functions.html#open" title="open"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">open()</span></code></a>’s <em>encoding</em> and
<em>errors</em> parameters which are interpreted just like those in <a class="reference internal" href="../library/stdtypes.html#str.encode" title="str.encode"><code class="xref py py-meth docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str.encode()</span></code></a>

<p>Reading Unicode from a file is therefore simple:</p>

</div>
<p>It’s also possible to open files in update mode, allowing both reading and

</div>
<p>The Unicode character <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">U+FEFF</span></code> is used as a byte-order mark (BOM), and is often
written as the first character of a file in order to assist with autodetection
of the file’s byte ordering.  Some encodings, such as UTF-16, expect a BOM to be
present at the start of a file; when such an encoding is used, the BOM will be
automatically written as the first character and will be silently dropped when
the file is read.  There are variants of these encodings, such as ‘utf-16-le’
and ‘utf-16-be’ for little-endian and big-endian encodings, that specify one
particular byte ordering and don’t skip the BOM.</p>
<p>In some areas, it is also convention to use a “BOM” at the start of UTF-8
encoded files; the name is misleading since UTF-8 is not byte-order dependent.
The mark simply announces that the file is encoded in UTF-8.  Use the
‘utf-8-sig’ codec to automatically skip the mark if present for reading such
files.</p>

<h3>Unicode filenames<a class="headerlink" href="#unicode-filenames" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most of the operating systems in common use today support filenames that contain
arbitrary Unicode characters.  Usually this is implemented by converting the
Unicode string into some encoding that varies depending on the system.  For
example, Mac OS X uses UTF-8 while Windows uses a configurable encoding; on
Windows, Python uses the name “mbcs” to refer to whatever the currently
configured encoding is.  On Unix systems, there will only be a filesystem
encoding if you’ve set the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LANG</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LC_CTYPE</span></code> environment variables; if
you haven’t, the default encoding is UTF-8.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="../library/sys.html#sys.getfilesystemencoding" title="sys.getfilesystemencoding"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.getfilesystemencoding()</span></code></a> function returns the encoding to use on
your current system, in case you want to do the encoding manually, but there’s
not much reason to bother.  When opening a file for reading or writing, you can
usually just provide the Unicode string as the filename, and it will be
automatically converted to the right encoding for you:</p>
<div class="highlight-python3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">filename</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;filename</span><span class="se">\u4500</span><span class="s1">abc&#39;</span>
<span class="k">with</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;w&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">:</span>

<p>Functions in the <a class="reference internal" href="../library/os.html#module-os" title="os: Miscellaneous operating system interfaces."><code class="xref py py-mod docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">os</span></code></a> module such as <a class="reference internal" href="../library/os.html#os.stat" title="os.stat"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">os.stat()</span></code></a> will also accept Unicode
filenames.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference internal" href="../library/os.html#os.listdir" title="os.listdir"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">os.listdir()</span></code></a> function returns filenames and raises an issue: should it return
the Unicode version of filenames, or should it return bytes containing
the encoded versions?  <a class="reference internal" href="../library/os.html#os.listdir" title="os.listdir"><code class="xref py py-func docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">os.listdir()</span></code></a> will do both, depending on whether you
provided the directory path as bytes or a Unicode string.  If you pass a
Unicode string as the path, filenames will be decoded using the filesystem’s
encoding and a list of Unicode strings will be returned, while passing a byte
path will return the filenames as bytes.  For example,
assuming the default filesystem encoding is UTF-8, running the following
program:</p>
<div class="highlight-python3 notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">fn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;filename</span><span class="se">\u4500</span><span class="s1">abc&#39;</span>

<span class="n">f</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">close</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>will produce the following output:</p>
<div class="highlight-shell-session notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">amk:~$</span> python t.py

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The first list contains UTF-8-encoded filenames, and the second list contains
the Unicode versions.</p>
<p>Note that on most occasions, the Unicode APIs should be used.  The bytes APIs
should only be used on systems where undecodable file names can be present,
i.e. Unix systems.</p>

<h3>Tips for Writing Unicode-aware Programs<a class="headerlink" href="#tips-for-writing-unicode-aware-programs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This section provides some suggestions on writing software that deals with
Unicode.</p>
<p>The most important tip is:</p>
<blockquote>
<div>Software should only work with Unicode strings internally, decoding the input
data as soon as possible and encoding the output only at the end.</div></blockquote>
<p>If you attempt to write processing functions that accept both Unicode and byte
strings, you will find your program vulnerable to bugs wherever you combine the
two different kinds of strings.  There is no automatic encoding or decoding: if
you do e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">str</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">bytes</span></code>, a <a class="reference internal" href="../library/exceptions.html#TypeError" title="TypeError"><code class="xref py py-exc docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">TypeError</span></code></a> will be raised.</p>
<p>When using data coming from a web browser or some other untrusted source, a
common technique is to check for illegal characters in a string before using the
string in a generated command line or storing it in a database.  If you’re doing
this, be careful to check the decoded string, not the encoded bytes data;
some encodings may have interesting properties, such as not being bijective
or not being fully ASCII-compatible.  This is especially true if the input
data also specifies the encoding, since the attacker can then choose a
clever way to hide malicious text in the encoded bytestream.</p>

<h4>Converting Between File Encodings<a class="headerlink" href="#converting-between-file-encodings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">surrogateescape</span></code> error handler will decode any non-ASCII bytes

U+DCFF.  These private code points will then be turned back into the
